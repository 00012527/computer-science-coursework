# I have completed this project within three years and confronted many diificulties. Particularly, to show pygame screen, i spent around a day. Anyway thanks to the technology, websites that are specialised in python and mostly you tube chanels helped me to correct mistakes and complete the project. Surprisingly i have learned how to create a game and i believe, this is just beginning of my career.

i could not make it private Github because i did not whom to share even if i made it private
